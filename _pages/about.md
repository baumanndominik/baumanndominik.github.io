I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Thomas Sch√∂n at Uppsala University, Sweden. My research focuses on the interplay of systems and control theory with machine learning and communication networks. Currently, one of my main focus areas is causal inference in control systems.

I received a diploma in electrical engineering in 2016 from TU Dresden, Germany. Afterwards, I was a joint PhD student with the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, supervised by Sebastian Trimpe, and KTH Stockholm, Sweden, where I worked with Karl H. Johansson. I defended my PhD thesis in 2020 and then joined RWTH Aachen University, Germany, for a one year postdoc.
