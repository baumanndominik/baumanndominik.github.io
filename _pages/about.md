From January 2023 on, I will join Aalto University in Espoo, Finland as assistant professor. Until then, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Thomas Schön at Uppsala University, Sweden. My research focuses on the interplay of systems and control theory with machine learning and communication networks. Currently, one of my main focus areas is causal inference in control systems.

I received a diploma in electrical engineering in 2016 from TU Dresden, Germany. Afterwards, I was a joint PhD student with the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, supervised by Sebastian Trimpe, and KTH Stockholm, Sweden, where I worked with Karl H. Johansson. I defended my PhD thesis in 2020 and then joined RWTH Aachen University, Germany, for a one year postdoc.
